<!--Almost all animals exploit vocal signals for a range of ecologically-motivated purposes: from detecting predators/prey and marking territory, to expressing emotions, establishing social relations and sharing information. Whether itâ€™s a bird raising an alarm, a whale calling to potential partners, a dog responding to human commands, a parent reading a story with a child, or a businessperson accessing stock prices using Siri on an iPhone, vocalisation provides a valuable communications channel through which behaviour may be coordinated and controlled, and information may be distributed and acquired. Indeed, the ubiquity of vocal interaction has led to research across a diverse array of fields, from assessing animal welfare, to understanding the precursors of human language, to developing voice-based human-machine interaction. Clearly, there is potential for cross-fertilisation between disciplines; for example, using robots to investigate contemporary theories of language grounding, using machine learning to analyse different habitats or adding vocal expressivity to the next generation of autonomous social agents. However, many opportunities remain unexplored, not least due to the lack of a suitable forum.

**VIHAR-2021** is the third international workshop on **Vocal Interactivity in-and-between Humans, Animals and Robots**. Taking place virtyally in Paris, Frabce on 13-15 October 2021, VIHAR-2021 aims to bring together researchers studying vocalisation and speech-based interaction in-and-between humans, animals and robots from a variety of different fields. VIHAR-2021 will provide an opportunity to share and discuss theoretical insights, best practices, tools and methodologies, and to identify common principles underpinning vocal behaviour in a multi-disciplinary environment.

 We are aiming to keep the registration fee as low as possible.

The workshop follows the success of previous international workshops on Vocal Interactivity in-and-between Humans, Animals and Robots ([VIHAR-2017](http://vihar-2017.vihar.org/), [VIHAR-2019](http://vihar-2019.vihar.org/)). If you wish to join the VIHAR community, you can read more about us here, subscribe to our mailing list here, follow the VIHAR-2021 twitter account or [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1447726768643928/). -->

We invite original submissions of abstracts for work to be presented as a "virtual poster" during the workshop, on topics in all areas of vocal interactivity. Accepted abstracts will be compiled in the **VIHAR-2021 proceedings**.

Suggested workshop topics may include, but are not limited to the following areas:
- Physiological and morphological comparisons between vocal systems in animals
- Properties and functions of animal signals
- Evolution of vocal interactivity
- Vocal imitation and learning
- Conveyance of emotion
- Comparative analyses of human and animal vocalisations
- Use of vocalisation
- Vocal interactivity between non-conspecifics
- Spoken language systems
- Technology-based research methods
- Vocal interaction with robots
