<!--Sonja Vernes is the leader of the Neurogenetics of Vocal Communication group. Sonja obtained her PhD in Neurogenetics from The University of Oxford and is currently a ‘Max Planck Research Group Leader’ holding a W2 position in the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. She is also an affiliated Principal Investigator at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University. Her research interests focus on the genetic bases of human language and the use of bats as a model for vocal communication that can inform the biological encoding and evolution of this trait. Sonja is a founding director of the Bat1K genome sequencing consortium ([http://www.bat1k.com](http://www.bat1k.com)) and a FENS-Kavli Network of Excellence Scholar ([http://fenskavlinetwork.org](http://fenskavlinetwork.org)).
