### Invited Discussants

###  Jennifer Cunha
Jennifer Cunha is an attorney, animal cognition trainer, writer, and international speaker, focusing on animal literacy and communication. She’s been featured in Bird Talk magazine, has twice written articles for the International Association of Applied Behavior Consultants Journal and is a frequent lecturer at science conventions and companion bird gatherings around the world. Jennifer collaborates on animal literacy and communication projects with university researchers and her research has been published in peer-reviewed scientific proceedings. Jennifer is co-owner of Parrot Kindergarten, Inc., a company focusing on enhanced enrichment and communication training for parrot caregivers.

###  Katarzyna (Kasia) Pisanski
Katarzyna (Kasia) Pisanski is a permanent CNRS researcher (National Centre for Scientific Research) affiliated with the University of Lyon, France, and working in collaboration with the University of Wrocław, Poland. Having obtained her PhD in 2014 from McMaster University, Canada, she now leads a successful research program on human and animal behaviour with a focus on acoustic communication. Kasia employs a multidisciplinary comparative and experimental approach to study the origins, ontogeny, development, mechanisms, and evolved social functions of nonverbal voice production and perception across human cultures and mammalian species.   

###  Reiji Suzuki
Reiji Suzuki is Associate Professor at the Department of Complex Systems Science, Graduate School of Informatics, Nagoya University in Nagoya, Japan. He is investigating interactions between evolutionary and ecological processes (eco-evo-devo) using artificial life approaches such as agent-based models and artificial creatures. Recently, he is also interested in understanding acoustic interactions among songbirds as complex systems (e.g., temporal sound space partitioning based on acoustic niche hypothesis), and applying robot audition techniques (an integrated open-source framework for sound source localization, separation and classification in real-time, called HARK) to better observation of their spatial-spectral-temporal patterns in field conditions. He is a member of International Society of Artificial Life.
